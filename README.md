# About Me :rocket:

My name is Nick and I am passionate about bringing exciting ideas to life through the means of code!

Since a child, I have always had a vivid imagination and amazing knack for problem solving; however, growing up I never had any exposure to programming or any other tech related subjects.

It wasn't until my junior years of college that I had the wonderful oppurtunity of taking a computer science class that taught the basics of programming using C++. It was at this point I was finally exposed to the rich world of software devlopement and I was hooked.

Shortly after taking this class I began reading books and making efforts to learn more about programming. Starting off with HTML and CSS I had the intention of kicking off my coding career by teaching myself web development. 

As I began exploring the world of JavaScript, I found myself struggling to fully understand some of the core fundamentals of web development and began doing research in hopes of finding a mentor that could help guide me on this journey.

In my search, I stumbled across LearningFuze Full Immersion bootcamp and after reading through an abundance of former student experiences with LearningFuze, I decided to take a leap and enroll myself in the program.

During my time at LearningFuze, I spent over 800 hours (70 hours per week) learning web devevlopment under the guidance of senior developers.

Today I am proud to call my self a fullstack developer and I look forward to expanding my knowledge and building real world applications that intend to push the capabalities, and challenge the limits of our modern day society. 

If you would like to reach to me to discuss how I can help in the development of your project, please see my contact information below. <br>
